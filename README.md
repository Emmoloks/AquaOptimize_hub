📖 Project Overview
The Water Tracking System is designed to solve the issues of water management and distribution using blockchain technology. By leveraging the ICP blockchain, we aim to:

🔍 Ensure Transparency: Every transaction and data entry related to water distribution is securely recorded on the blockchain.
✅ Improve Accountability: All stakeholders can access the data, making it easier to hold parties accountable for water usage and distribution.
📊 Optimize Water Resource Management: Real-time data and analytics help manage water resources more effectively.
✨ Features
🔗 Decentralized Ledger: All data entries are stored on a decentralized ledger, ensuring data integrity and security.
📡 Real-Time Monitoring: Track water distribution and consumption in real-time.
🤖 Smart Contracts: Automate various processes such as billing, reporting, and alerts.
🖥️ User-Friendly Interface: Accessible to all stakeholders, including water suppliers, consumers, and regulatory authorities.
